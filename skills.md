#### <i class="devicon-python-plain-wordmark"></i> `Python`:
- **Key Libraries**: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Tensorflow`, `Matplotlib`, `SkiKitLearn`, `Biopython`, etc.
- **Experience**: CS1 at Dartmouth, work in bioinformatics, and personal projects. See [my Tensorflow project](/experiences/antibody-ml) page or my [bioinformatics internship](/experiences/bioinformatics) page for details.

#### <i class="devicon-java-plain"></i> `Java`
- **Experience**: Coursework in CS10 AP Computer Science. Built several applications in this course, including a huffman file compression algorithm, a viturbi machine learnign algorithm, and a client/server program that allows multiple users to collaborate over the internet on a shared digital drawing (think Google Draw).

#### <i class="devicon-c-plain"></i> `C`
- **Experience**: Gained a background in C through my CS50 course at Dartmouth. Wrote several thousand lines of code. See my [tiny search engine](https://gitlab.com/kenneym/tse) or my [cs50 final project](https://gitlab.com/kenneym/cs50-maze-project) for a look at some of the CS50 projects I completed.

#### ![matlab](/assets/images/matlab.png) `Matlab`
- **Experience**: Learned Matlab through "Foundations of Applied CS" (CS11) at Dartmouth. Projects included applying linear algebra for image manipulation projects such as [Gradient Domain Fusion using Poisson Blending](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs129/results/proj2/taox/), employing [Expectation-maximization models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm), and designing simple [linear classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier).
 
#### ![VHDL](/assets/images/fpga-icon.png) `VHDL`
- **Experience**: I learned Digital Logic and VHDL through my Digital Electronics (CS56) Course at Dartmouth. You can view some of my work by taking a look at my [RSA Encryption Module](/experiences/fpga-rsa/)

#### <i class="devicon-mysql-plain"></i> `SQL`
- **Experience**: I learned SQL through an online course offered by IBM. Throughout the next few months, I plan to learn Hadoop & Aparche Spark to better equip myself in the field of computer science.
