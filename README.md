# [Personal Website](https://mtnkenney.com)
This repository contains the HTML, Markdown, CSS, and YML configuration files for my personal website. The site is built with Jekyll and hosted on github pages. It builds off the ["basically-basic"](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic#github-pages-method) Jekyll/ github pages theme.
