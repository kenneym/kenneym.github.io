For my Computational Neuroscience final project, I decided to build a TensorFlow application. This project builds off of my former work in [bioinformatics at Cell Signaling Technologies](/experiences/bioinformatics). Using only protein-sequence information as input, I designed a Convolutional Neural Net to correctly predict antibody origin species.
