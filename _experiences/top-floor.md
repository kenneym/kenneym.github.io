Freshman year, my friend Jake Epstein and I started a specialty cold brew company, [Morton's Top Floor Coffee Co](https://topfloorcoffee.com). We began with a simple goal: bringing quaity and convenience to the Dartmouth coffee scene. Over the second half of our freshman year, Jake, I, and our third-man Josh Cherner built a specialty cold-brew coffee company & operated directly on campus. We delievered "cold shot" cold brew concentrate drinks to students working late into the night or gearing up for a night out, and delivered direct-to-dorm cold brew drinks to our weekly subscribers each Monday.

After many months working to build our company, our efforts culminated in an offer for 30% equity and $300,000 in manufacturing backing to spearhead a new product division for one of the 4 largest cold brew manufacturers in the US. Ultimately, however, we decided to decline the offer due to a required 2-year period off from school. Although I have since moved on from the company, the process of founding Top Floor enlightened me to the incredible complexity behind even the simplest of companies. Through this projuect I developed my skills as a leader and manager, educated myself in buisness strategy, and learned how to enage in proper negotiation.
