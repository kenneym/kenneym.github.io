#### Bioinformatics at Cell Signaling Technologies
While at CST I Worked to spearhead CST’s exploration of computational chemistry for antibody development, performed extensive research and code development in the drug discovery space, developed key enterprise and academic partners for CST’s computational efforts moving forward, and wrote advisory documentation for the company to move forward. Further, I built upon and containerized existing molecular dynamics codes for use on GPU-enabled cloud services. For a visual on my summer, click on my poster for the summer and check it out.
