introduction: |
  
  Thanks for visiting! My name is Matt Kenney. I am a Dartmouth Junior, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Outside of class, I've conducted research for pathology and microbiology labs, cofounded a specialty cold brew company, worked as a bioinformatics intern, and have delved into numerous projects on my own time. Currently, I am studying computer science and buisness at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/home) (I've left an image I took at the top of the page). As a technologist, my interests lie in:
  - Data Analytics
  - DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure
  - Machine Learning
  - Bioinformatics / Computational Biology
  - Applications of Biology to Computer Science (i.e. things like [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/))
  - Hardware Design
