  # About Me

  <img class="circular--portrait" src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg">
  
  Thanks for visiting! My name is Matt Kenney. I am a Senior at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Outside of class, I've interned as a software engineer for [Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon/), as a Product Manager for [Pegasystems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pegasystems/), and as Bioinformatician for [Cell Signaling Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cell-signaling-technology/), I've conducted research for pathology and microbiology labs, cofounded a specialty cold brew company, chaired the Student Leadership Board for the Magnsuon Center for Entrepreneurship, and have delved into numerous projects on my own time. As a technologist, my interests lie in:
  - Data Analytics
  - DevOps and Cloud
  - Infrastructure as Code (IoC)
  - Machine Learning
  - Bioinformatics / Computational Biology
  - Applications of Biology to Computer Science (i.e. things like [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/))
