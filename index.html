introduction: |

  Thanks for visiting! This site is designed as a simple guide to my mind, skills, and experiences. 
  
  I am a Dartmouth Junior, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Outside of class, I've conducted research for pathology and microbiology labs, cofounded a specialty cold brew company, worked as a bioinformatics intern, and have delved into numerous personal development projects. As a technologist, my interests lie in:
  - Data Analytics
  - DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure
  - Machine Learning
  - Bioinformatics / Computational Biology
  - Applications of Biology to Computer Science (i.e. things like [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/))
  - Hardware Design
